To generate a key pair, open Cygwin and issue the following commands ($> is the command prompt):
$> ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
$> cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

A whimper sounds plaintive or submissive.
A grunt or a groan doesn't sound ladylike.
A squeal sounds too drawn out.
